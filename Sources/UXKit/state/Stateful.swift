import Foundation

/// Wraps and links a property of a `StateMachineDelegate` to its
/// `StateMachine`, transforming the property into a managed *state*. Whenever
/// the value of this property changes, the `StateMachine` emits an update event
/// to the `StateMachineDelegate`, where the update cycle can be handled. The
/// wrapped property can be an optional type.
///
/// When transforming this property into a state, you can optionally assign one
/// or more `StateType`s to it by specifying the first parameter of this
/// property wrapper. When the value of the state is changed, its key path
/// (relative to the property owner) is marked as dirty along with all its
/// associated state types.
///
/// To conditionally prevent a new value from being assigned, you can provide
/// the `willSet` parameter, a block with the old value and new value as
/// arguments, which must be satisfied whenever a new value is assigned to the
/// state. If the block returns `true`, the new value will be assigned. If
/// `false`, the new value will not be assigned. Note that in either case,
/// Swift's native `didSet` block will still be triggered for the wrapped
/// property.
///
/// To handle the event when a new value is successfully assigned, you can
/// provide the `didSet` parameter, which is a block consisting of the old value
/// and the new value as arguments. This parameter should not be confused with
/// the built-in `didSet` block of Swift properties. The difference is that the
/// `didSet` parameter of this property wrapper only triggers when the state
/// value has changed, whereas the built-in `didSet` block gets triggered
/// regardless of whether the value was changed. You can omit this parameter and
/// achieve the same behavior with the native `didSet` block by utilizing the
/// `projectedValue` of this property wrapper and checking the `isDirty` flag:
///
/// ```
/// @Stateful
/// var foo: String = "foo" { didSet { if $foo.isDirty { // Do something when
///   the value has changed
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that the native `didSet` block is triggered **after** the update cycle
/// is resolved.
///
/// **Warning**: This property wrapper uses private API and causes segmentation
/// fault in the compiler if the type constraint of the property owner is not
/// satisfied.
